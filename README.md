# Voice Chatbot - Frontend

Practical example of a booking-transport website with a chatbot controlled by voice, in Spanish. To make it work, the voice-chatbot project has to be executed in the background as well.

## Content of the project
- Text-to-speech: for the system to replay the messages generated by the bot.
- Speech-to-text: to transcribe what the user says.
- OpenAI usage: to initiate a conversation and complete the booking information.
  
## How to execute project
```
ng serve --open
```
